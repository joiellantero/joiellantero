## Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm Joie. Iâ€™m a computer engineering student at the University of the Philippines Diliman. I've been a layout artist for seven years now and I'm also a self-taught full-stack web developer and UI/UX Designer.  

My dream is to create software that serves the community. Through software, I am able to help create better experiences for people and empower others to a also reach their own dreams. I like creating websites that provides better online presence and services for individuals, organizations, and companies.
